Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.,https://lablab.ai/tech/whisper
"The Whisper models are trained for speech recognition and translation tasks, capable of transcribing speech audio into the text in the language it is spoken (ASR) as well as translated into English (speech translation). Whisper has been trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. Whisper is Encoder-Decoder model. Input audio is split into 30-second chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. A decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps, multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speech translation.",https://lablab.ai/tech/whisper

"This is a small web service project that allows you to upload a mp3 audio or provide a youtube link - the source audio then gets transcribed and summarized by openAi models. The project was realized as part of OpenAI Whisper, GPT3, Codex & DALL-E 2 Hackathon together with colonelWalterKurtz and PioSikorski. The app was realized using python 3.10 with libraries such as Flask, openai, moviepy and pytube. The audio transcript is fed into the GPT-3 model in several pieces to ensure that it does not shorten and erase too much information. The prototype allows to convert short videos efficiently however it takes significantly more time to process longer audio files due to slow working of the requests to each model. The project provides a proof of concept that could potentailly be useful to many people who often do not wish to spend much time listening to audio files such as podcasts and if improved could allow to deliver such service online.",https://lablab.ai/tech/whisper

"Our education platform aims to revolutionize the way students learn by providing a unique and personalized learning experience. Through the use of semantic search, we enable users to easily find specific moments in a video that discuss a particular concept, making it easier for them to focus on and understand the material. Additionally, we recommend people with similar interests to connect with each other, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among learners. Lastly, we recommend posts to users based on their interests, ensuring that they are constantly exposed to relevant and engaging content of the user with same interests.",https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere

"We created an application to ease the lives of team leaders, by creating a fast and effortless pipeline to propagate the needed information to their teams, other than storing trivial information in pills for a more concise backtracking experience. Starting with OpenAI Whisper, we generate a transcription of the meeting, then by crossing the work of Cohere Generate and Classify, we managed to extract the needed information, then we organize them into a comfortable format to make sure they are easily findable. We developed a platform designed that recaps full business meetings and provides concise summaries including all the relevant information, a list of tasks mentioned during the meeting and the questions asked, with the relative answers. We thought this information was the most useful for a team's member, so the leader can send them the information fast, in order to fill a lack of knowledge and consequent slowdowns in the team's productivity.",https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere
"Messenger apps like Discord & Slack have ""channels"" where multiple parties can send hundreds of texts daily. This can get out of hand pretty quickly if you've been offline, and we've sometimes had to scroll through hundreds of messages to understand what we've missed. The issue is that there isn't a quick & accessible way to figure things out. Tal;dera is a Discord bot that provides an easy-to-read, semantically rich summary of a channel's Discord activity in a particular time range. The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats. Even though this was a challenging project for us, we were happy with what we were able to get done, and believe that this project has potential for B2B SaaS applications to team managers, employees, and chat service providers. We hope to continue this project by running pilot tests with smaller communities so that they can give feedback on Tal;dera, the summarizer bot for missed activity in Discord channels.",https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere
The goal is to provide an interactive tool for visualizing research papers in a 2D map where the papers are placed on the map based on some vector embedding of the summary. The papers that are similar to each other will cluster together. This will allow researchers to identify papers that have similar concepts and even allow users to look at concepts from different fields that are applicable in their own field.,https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere
"Perfect Prompt is a one stop shop for prompt engineering and image generation. Currently, generating images with prompts for free can be costly with respect to time and money. Perfect Prompt allows you to experiment with your prompt before submitting it several times to a image generation model. Just type in a prompt, and Perfect Prompt will generate an image as well 10 variations of the input prompt with a given art style. First, Perfect Prompt identifies the art style using cohere classify, and matches it to one of five. Then, this style is added to an internal prompt, which asks cohere generate to create variations of the input prompt. These prompts are then ranked again by the classifier, and only the top ten are returned. The user may use any details from these to create their next prompt, and generate another image!",https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere
"Tarinyoom is a Discord chat bot that allows users to search for messages using a fuzzy search to better retrieve past messages. The bot uses the co:here API ""Embed"" tool to map discord messages onto their corresponding embedding vectors. These vectors are then stored in a back-end pinecone.io instance, so that their cosine similarities can be evaluated. The bot has two main commands: ""/tsleuth"" and ""/tsearch <string>"". ""/tsleuth"" instructs the bot to crawl the server that the command was issued in, storing the vector embeddings of any messages found as entries in the pinecone.io instance. ""/tsearch <string>"" instructs the bot to find the message whose vector embedding most closely resembles the vector embedding of the passed parameter, as evaluated by pinecone.io. Using these two commands, users can search for a past conversation with only a high-level recollection of the topics discussed, instead of having to exactly match to text in that conversation, as required by the current Discord search feature.",https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere

It is a variant of the GPT-3 model, which was specifically designed to be used to generate text in response to user input. The ChatGPT model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, including conversations and other types of human-generated text, which allows it to generate text that is similar in style and content to human conversation. ChatGPT can be used to generate responses to questions, code, make suggestions, or provide information in a conversational manner, and it is able to do so in a way that is often indistinguishable from human-generated text. The initial model has been trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using methods similar to InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. The model is trained using supervised fine-tuning, where human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant.

"Messenger apps like Discord & Slack have ""channels"" where multiple parties can send hundreds of texts daily. This can get out of hand pretty quickly if you've been offline, and we've sometimes had to scroll through hundreds of messages to understand what we've missed. The issue is that there isn't a quick & accessible way to figure things out. Tal;dera is a Discord bot that provides an easy-to-read, semantically rich summary of a channel's Discord activity in a particular time range. The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats. Even though this was a challenging project for us, we were happy with what we were able to get done, and believe that this project has potential for B2B SaaS applications to team managers, employees, and chat service providers. We hope to continue this project by running pilot tests with smaller communities so that they can give feedback on Tal;dera, the summarizer bot for missed activity in Discord channels.",https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-thanksgiving-hackathon

We aim to provide a one-click tool for non-experts to create FAQs and responses for common use cases such as customer support. *Input*: the user can select relevant offline and online documents, such as a product description webpage, internal posts and emails. *Output*: the tool generates a list of FAQs and their answer in a number of uniform styles, e.g., formal, friendly, fun-with-emojis. *Deploy:* with built-in integrations the generated content can be published on a website or chatbot to serve automated answers. In this hackathon we focus on a proof-of-concept service that is able to extract text from a landing page and generate the company name, sector, and FAQs with appropriate answers. In particular, we demonstrate how zero-shot text generation works i) in a simple web application on Streamlit, and ii) on a web app on our systems (Helvia.io) that also puts the generated content into a running chatbot.",https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-thanksgiving-hackathon
"Matching effective mental health therapy that suits you the most, precisely using Cohere Classify artificial intelligence tool.

"Tarinyoom is a Discord chat bot that allows users to search for messages using a fuzzy search to better retrieve past messages. The bot uses the co:here API ""Embed"" tool to map discord messages onto their corresponding embedding vectors. These vectors are then stored in a back-end pinecone.io instance, so that their cosine similarities can be evaluated. The bot has two main commands: ""/tsleuth"" and ""/tsearch <string>"". ""/tsleuth"" instructs the bot to crawl the server that the command was issued in, storing the vector embeddings of any messages found as entries in the pinecone.io instance. ""/tsearch <string>"" instructs the bot to find the message whose vector embedding most closely resembles the vector embedding of the passed parameter, as evaluated by pinecone.io. Using these two commands, users can search for a past conversation with only a high-level recollection of the topics discussed, instead of having to exactly match to text in that conversation, as required by the current Discord search feature.",https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-ai-hackathon-embed/Tarinyoom/TarinyoomBot

"Today the number of literature readers is declining worldwide, especially among younger generations, which is affecting overall education level very negatively. This is mostly due to increasing popularity of online social media and gaming activities. However, technological development shouldn't mean for important knowledge to fade away. It is important to digitalize books and cognitive literature and adapt it to modern norms.

"Messenger apps like Discord & Slack have ""channels"" where multiple parties can send hundreds of texts daily. This can get out of hand pretty quickly if you've been offline, and we've sometimes had to scroll through hundreds of messages to understand what we've missed. The issue is that there isn't a quick & accessible way to figure things out. Tal;dera is a Discord bot that provides an easy-to-read, semantically rich summary of a channel's Discord activity in a particular time range. The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats. Even though this was a challenging project for us, we were happy with what we were able to get done, and believe that this project has potential for B2B SaaS applications to team managers, employees, and chat service providers. We hope to continue this project by running pilot tests with smaller communities so that they can give feedback on Tal;dera, the summarizer bot for missed activity in Discord channels.",https://lablab.ai/event/cohere-thanksgiving-hackathon/CloseAI%20Deceptacons/TALDERA

"Long story short, many LLM models have broken into the mainstream and flooded all social media platforms this year. Everyone heard in 2022 about ChatGPT (million users in 5 days), which outbeat instagram which needed 2,5 months! I think everyone saw at least once in 2022 a graphic generated by Dall-e, Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. Millions of funds have been invested into the sector and I think everyone has an opinion about AI (for sure different ones have artists talking about copyright issues than health care professionals about how it improves their work). One is for sure - the AI industry is booming and we might be facing a fourth or fifth industrial revolution - depending on who and how it describes it.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"So, what’s more to come?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"2023 is set to be a revolutionary year for Artificial Intelligence. With the continued development of AI technology, more and more businesses are beginning to invest in the potential of AI to automate processes and increase efficiency. Thanks to open source technologies AI is also becoming more accessible and affordable for businesses, which will help to drive its adoption. It is no longer a monopol technology for the biggest tech giants.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"First and foremost, 2023 will see the emergence of AI-powered solutions for customer service - ChatGPT might be the simplest example. AI-powered solutions are designed to provide a more personalized customer experience and can even automate customer service tasks. Already in 2022 Cohere launched a multilingual model which supports 100+ languages and it’s super easy to implement. Furthermore, AI-powered solutions will be able to handle more complex customer inquiries and offer improved customer support.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"In addition to customer service, AI will also be used to enhance the accuracy and speed of decision-making processes in businesses. AI-powered solutions can process large amounts of data and make decisions quickly and accurately, which will help businesses make better decisions in less time. Remember the winners of OpenAI Whisper Hackathon, InvestogAId a transcription tool that will watch your favorite video about a stock trading strategy and implement it for you?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"Finally, AI will also be used to develop more advanced applications and products. AI-powered solutions can be used to create more innovative and sophisticated products and applications. This will help to boost the overall productivity and efficiency of businesses, as well as to create new opportunities and revenue streams. The question is what does app will be, and which problems of 2022 will they solve?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"The technology is still relatively young and the breakthrough is happening in front of our eyes. The revolution in usage of open source technologies allows everyone to create an AI based app, as previously it was only available to the tech giants. Today you can create an app based AI simply learning from our generative AI tutorials or during lablab.ai Hackathons. If you’re looking for ChatGPT API we also gather libraries for you in one place. Or if you want to get deeper into creating AI art or improve your creative process with AI, we also have Stable Diffusion tutorials.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai

"Visual storytelling is one of the many ways educators use to assist in the child's growth. However, often times educators will have to improvise when trying to find relevant material (movies or story books) that can help in guiding the child in a specific situation with the child's needs and accessibility accommodations. For example, a child with physical differences can be facing a situation from a different child and an educator is keen on addressing the situation. Therefore, developing a solution that can create custom images for storytelling based on the unique characteristics of the child can be very empowering to the educational system.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon

"Pictures generated by the Stable Diffusion are used for mental health therapeutic purposes. There are two main services, the free in-app plan and the premium chromotherapy in the metaverse. First of all, the main goal of the application is to be able to ask the users about their current mood and the reasons behind it to generate an image based on the theories of mental health and chroma therapy to improve overall mental health. The application first starts by asking about the overall mood of the user: Great, Good, Okay, Bad, Awful . Based on these questions the model generates an image that is soothing to the mood and improves the mood of the user throughout the day. Then, the metaverse is used to provide immersive chromotherapy in the metaverse for all. It consists of the panorama version or full-screen version of the picture being trained and generated using Stable Diffusion. Then, throughout the chromotherapy, we could let use relaxation-stimulating colors to provide immersive therapeutic experiences, whether it is the VR feature on ma mobile phone, the VR feature from a VR headset, the AR feature from an Apple device, and more that are compatible with Spatial XR.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon

"Messenger apps like Discord & Slack have ""channels"" where multiple parties can send hundreds of texts daily. This can get out of hand pretty quickly if you've been offline, and we've sometimes had to scroll through hundreds of messages to understand what we've missed. The issue is that there isn't a quick & accessible way to figure things out. Tal;dera is a Discord bot that provides an easy-to-read, semantically rich summary of a channel's Discord activity in a particular time range. The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats. Even though this was a challenging project for us, we were happy with what we were able to get done, and believe that this project has potential for B2B SaaS applications to team managers, employees, and chat service providers.

"Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are a type of image generation technique that work by iteratively ""de-noising"" data in a latent representation space, and then decoding the representation into a full image. This is in contrast to other popular image synthesis methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the auto-regressive technique used by DALL-E. The Stable Diffusion model is created by a collaboration between engineers and researchers from CompVis, Stability AI, and LAION and released under a Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license, wich means that it can be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The release of this file is the culmination of many hours of collective effort to compress the visual information of humanity into a few gigabytes.

"During the hackathon, we fine-tuned GPT-3 and built a self-analysis tool that helps one objectively assess their problem and develop new ideas for solving it. It can be used by people who can't access mental health care because of high prices and stigma. It is based on CBT and should be highly effective in the following cases: 1. A person has a problem and doesn't know how to solve it. For example, ""I can't keep up with deadlines,"" or ""My parents are overprotective."" 2. A person can't make a decision. ""Should I move?"", ""Should I accept an offer from a new company?"" etc. 3. A person can't sort out their thoughts. ""I can't understand why I'm so uncomfortable being a dad,"" ""Why have I become so irritable?"" etc. 4. A person wants to improve their relationship. ""I'm so jealous,"" ""We fight all the time,"" ""I'm not happy with my wife. I cheated, and I feel guilty"". In therapy, people who are objective about their situation and able to set specific goals tend to achieve better results. This tool does exactly that. A typical session consists of three parts: 1. Analysis. This part includes questions that make the person analyze various aspects of the situation and draw an objective picture. The essence of this part is the transition from an emotional to a rational perception of reality. 2. Empathy. It consists of a comprehensive generalizing statement aimed at supporting the client emotionally. 3. Decision. It consists of questions that allow the person to analyze the availability of resources and ways to solve the problem. Questions force the person to move from emotions to concrete steps toward the goal.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"Our idea for a Shopify Print on Demand app that uses DALL-E inpainting would be to create an app that allows users to add custom images to their products. The app would use DALL-E to personalize the images based on a description provided by the user. For example, a user might want to add a picture of their grandparent’s dog to a t-shirt. They could then add props like a “Santa hat” to the dog, and DALL-E would generate the image and add it to the t-shirt or any other POD product. This would allow users to easily customize their products with unique images without needing any design skills. Another use case for this could be using the DALL-E outpainting tool, where a user might upload a picture of their own dog and ask the app to put it in a certain environment, i.e. “space”. The app would significantly reduce the turnover time and processes of personalized POD (currently 1-3 days) and design costs (currently $1-$5/design). We would charge merchants just $1 for each actual purchase on their store that was made via PrintAi. Overall, the app would make it easy for personalized POD merchants to allow their customers to add custom, high-quality images to their products, making their online stores more unique and appealing to customers.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

Enter Customer Support GPT, it uses the company's internal knowledge such as frequently asked questions, articles, etc. to give company-specific answers. If it doesn't know the answer, it'll flag to be answered by a human. How it works: To get company-specific responses, Customer Support GPT does the following: Parse and create an index of company data. When an incoming customer support query is presented, the index is searched for the most relevant result(s). If none are present, flag it to a human reviewer. This result(s) are passed into GPT-3 along with the incoming query, to return a personalized, relevant response. Future work is to integrate with Zendesk, Crisp, and other providers to pre-generate answers and use in real life. Improve the GPT-3 prompt to return results that are closer to how customer support agents communicate Built by: Abdellatif - Ex-twitter engineer and founder of Tarteel.ai Ahmed - 17-year-old hacker, creator of remail.ai We're happy that you've reached this far, if you'd like to use the tool or have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out [email protected]",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon
"Our project is a guessing game where our user will attempt to guess the brand names from the logos shown in a webapp. The project will be built using the Python programming language via the python framework Streamlit. OpenAI will be used to provide speech-to-text capabilities for our project through the replicate API. We hope to target young kids with our project to teach them proper pronunciation and speaking through the playing of a guessing game using their voices. This project is therefore a small step towards what we hope to be able do in the future, to make learning fun and convenient, as games like this can be played by kids wherever and whenever.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon
"Our solution is a web app that generates PowerPoint presentations giving either a prompt about what the slides should cover or a summary of a specific topic. The purpose of this app is to make presentations using the power of AI quickly. Technology-wise, for the frontend client, we utilized Next.js, and for the backend server, we utilized Python’s Flask. For the AI handling, we utilized ChatGPT3 to generate slide text and titles. Additionally, we used Dall E 2 to create each image on the individual slides. Lastly, we used Vercel to host the front end and Heroku to host the backend.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon
"This is a small web service project that allows you to upload a mp3 audio or provide a youtube link - the source audio then gets transcribed and summarized by openAi models. The project was realized as part of OpenAI Whisper, GPT3, Codex & DALL-E 2 Hackathon together with colonelWalterKurtz and PioSikorski. The app was realized using python 3.10 with libraries such as Flask, openai, moviepy and pytube. The audio transcript is fed into the GPT-3 model in several pieces to ensure that it does not shorten and erase too much information. The prototype allows to convert short videos efficiently however it takes significantly more time to process longer audio files due to slow working of the requests to each model. The project provides a proof of concept that could potentailly be useful to many people who often do not wish to spend much time listening to audio files such as podcasts and if improved could allow to deliver such service online.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"By offering a user-friendly and adaptable framework for website building, this project leverages text-DaVinci-003 and Whisper to create websites for people. This may be especially useful for individuals and small businesses that lack the technical skills or resources to create their own websites from scratch. To use the platform, a user would likely interact with their keyboards or whisper through a natural language interface. The user would provide information about their websites, such as the type of content they want to include and the design elements they prefer, and our application would use this information to generate a website based on pre-designed templates and customizations.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"Alternative name (BitVote.net) full concept here: http://bitvote.net/?page_id=41 Relevant description / summary Alternative name (BitVote.net) entire concept here: http://bitvote.net/?page_id=41 Relevant description/summary textCollab is likely going to be stage 1 to 3 from the whole BitVote idea above. BitVote will start to operate at the discussion and proposal creation level. Off-setting the discussion to more internet platforms (such as Reddit, in the future). As step one in the process, textCollab/BitVote users may pick up a popular question or issue in their respective community. In the next step, the users start proposals sessions on this platform to address the question or any of the available questions. Anyone can start a question or issue on BitVote, similar to sites like Quora. If the case matches the keywords or content of another already in the system, the user is encouraged to review the previous one. He can still go ahead and create a similar proposal or text document, but the algorithm will still group it thematically based on content and keywords. As soon as that is done, anyone that is registered with the system can see new issues by region, type, language, or other keywords. A brand new issue or question will still need to have proposals in it. One can start writing a proposal for the question at hand. One of the essential central features of BitVote, is the editor, and this will be the textCollab project. As the user is writing the algorithm is dynamically scanning the content. Searching through any sources (Wikipedia, internet archives, academic journals, meta-searches in search engines), and presenting the results as a part of the screen (for computers as devices; a secondary tab with notices for mobile devices). One additional source will be the textCollab database, scanning for similarities between the current and previous proposals already in the system. From the thematic content analysis, the user can see relevant papers and sources that can quickly inform him to improve his proposal or use them as sources. Suppose the proposal is very high in similarity with another. In that case, the user will be prompted to join in support of that proposal unless there are any additions or sub-versions to that proposal. The aim is to reduce the total amount of proposals and foster synthesis. Thus, creating more complete proposals from many authors in the system. This stage can take weeks, depending on the configuration of the person who is running this proposal instance has chosen. Furthermore, there may be competing proposal chains in the system with different configurations. If both are set to public view, both can benefit from existing content and work in the textCollab archive. On the other hand, there are cases where a BitVote process will be started by a corporate entity or organization where only select groups of people will have electronic access keys to see the full content (or any configuration of the above). In the case of competing proposals, one may arrive at a solution using different time periods, different groups of people and different implementer(s) or auditor(s) of the voted solution. The content ranking should be done continuously but iterate until after the Proposal period. The rank value of every proposal (or synthesis of proposals, for that matter, for larger groups) is based on some of the following: Support by primary academic sources. (Max 0.5) Support by other literature. (Max 0.2) Education or specialization of the author (thematic match). (Max 0.1) Thematic match to the question addressed. (Max 0.1) User ranking and ratings. (Max 0.1) Potentially other factors. The voting stage is generally a simpler process but depending on the whole session or BitVote process configuration one can configure a vote with different rules appropriate for the occasion. And what should happen if a satisfactory result is not reached? Return to Proposal session for a set amount of time to foster more formal discussion, or re-iterate the Vote session until there is a clear result. Assuming there is a clear winner, this part of the process is done, now depending on the BitVote process configuration there can be a vote for who will be the implementer or a public competition for potential implementers to compete. The next stage can be assigned to an auditing authority that will assess and report back in the system how the implementation of the proposal went. All this stays in archival to be used continuously in the system and also for historical record. If a great proposal and implementation is reached that will be featured and highlighted to see what has been learned, but the same really for a failed proposal or implementation. We need such methods to be able to cope with the amount of information we will have to deal with in a large scale application of meritocratic democracy today – that means very big populations and thus countless submissions of proposals to dig through. That would be impossible without a smart collaboration design. The intent is to let the best ideas come forth, be expressed and compete. Choose democratically from those, and then implement and assess.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

Jason Calacanis is considered by many as one of the greatest startup investors of our time and predicts that the laid off tech workers will be the biggest winners for 2023.,https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"As Silicon Valley continues to right size across the biggest tech companies and the trend is expected to move across the globe, there is a major opportunity for those who are left without a job.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"According to Calacanis, these laid-off tech workers have the potential to become extremely successful if they band together in groups of two, three, or four and start their own companies. This is because, as Calacanis notes, these individuals possess the key skills necessary to build and run successful startups, including development, product management, and other important technical capabilities.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Calacanis argues that these laid-off tech workers can make ""incredible lemonade from these lemons"" by taking control of their own destinies and starting their own companies. In fact, he believes that the startup space will be dominated by these laid-off tech workers who choose to start their own businesses and that they will be the truly big winners in the coming year.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"There were 1,405 rounds of layoffs at tech companies globally just through the first week of December, affecting 219,959 people. These numbers are expected to grow across 2023.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"One key piece of advice that Calacanis offers is for these laid-off tech workers to start their companies with two or three friends. As he notes, this is because startups with multiple founders tend to get funded faster than those with only one. Additionally, having a team of developers and other talented individuals will be essential for success in the startup world.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Overall, Calacanis's prediction is a stark reminder that even the most difficult of circumstances can be turned into opportunities, and those who are willing to take a chance and create something new can truly succeed. For laid-off tech workers in 2023, it is a chance to ""take control of the destiny"" and to create something that they can truly be proud of.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Based on the boom of performance in AI technology of the last 24 months, generative AI will be the winning technology of 2023 and therefore the startups created by laid-off tech workers should focus on it, as it is one of the most promising and rapidly growing areas in technology today. Generative AI refers to systems that can generate new and unique outputs, such as natural language, images, and music, based on a set of inputs and algorithms.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Calacanis believes that the demand for Generative AI-powered products and services will only continue to increase in the coming years and that startups in this field will have a significant advantage. With the trend of automation and the increasing adoption of AI in various industry verticals, businesses are looking for more advanced AI solutions.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Startups that are focused on Generative AI can leverage their technical skills to develop cutting-edge products and services that can help to drive innovation and growth in a wide range of industries. From healthcare, and finance to retail and beyond, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Furthermore, Generative AI startups also have the potential to attract large amounts of funding from venture capitalists and other investors, as this is an area of high interest for them.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"In conclusion, Calacanis's prediction of laid-off tech workers becoming truly big winners in 2023 by starting their own companies, especially if they focus on Generative AI is an exciting prospect. It presents an opportunity for them to not just overcome the setback of losing their jobs but also capitalize on the future of technology and leverage it to create something that can change the world.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
