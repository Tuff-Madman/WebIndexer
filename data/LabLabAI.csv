"Long story short, many LLM models have broken into the mainstream and flooded all social media platforms this year. Everyone heard in 2022 about ChatGPT (million users in 5 days), which outbeat instagram which needed 2,5 months! I think everyone saw at least once in 2022 a graphic generated by Dall-e, Stable Diffusion or Midjourney. Millions of funds have been invested into the sector and I think everyone has an opinion about AI (for sure different ones have artists talking about copyright issues than health care professionals about how it improves their work). One is for sure - the AI industry is booming and we might be facing a fourth or fifth industrial revolution - depending on who and how it describes it.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"So, what’s more to come?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"2023 is set to be a revolutionary year for Artificial Intelligence. With the continued development of AI technology, more and more businesses are beginning to invest in the potential of AI to automate processes and increase efficiency. Thanks to open source technologies AI is also becoming more accessible and affordable for businesses, which will help to drive its adoption. It is no longer a monopol technology for the biggest tech giants.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"First and foremost, 2023 will see the emergence of AI-powered solutions for customer service - ChatGPT might be the simplest example. AI-powered solutions are designed to provide a more personalized customer experience and can even automate customer service tasks. Already in 2022 Cohere launched a multilingual model which supports 100+ languages and it’s super easy to implement. Furthermore, AI-powered solutions will be able to handle more complex customer inquiries and offer improved customer support.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"In addition to customer service, AI will also be used to enhance the accuracy and speed of decision-making processes in businesses. AI-powered solutions can process large amounts of data and make decisions quickly and accurately, which will help businesses make better decisions in less time. Remember the winners of OpenAI Whisper Hackathon, InvestogAId a transcription tool that will watch your favorite video about a stock trading strategy and implement it for you?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"Finally, AI will also be used to develop more advanced applications and products. AI-powered solutions can be used to create more innovative and sophisticated products and applications. This will help to boost the overall productivity and efficiency of businesses, as well as to create new opportunities and revenue streams. The question is what does app will be, and which problems of 2022 will they solve?",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-why-2023-will-be-the-year-of-ai
"The technology is still relatively young and the breakthrough is happening in front of our eyes. The revolution in usage of open source technologies allows everyone to create an AI based app, as previously it was only available to the tech giants. Today you can create an app based AI simply learning from our generative AI tutorials or during lablab.ai Hackathons. If you’re looking for ChatGPT API we also gather libraries for you in one place.

This can solve the design problem of many people who work in engineering and architecture or anything relating to design, even though our main focus is on CADs. This can also be used as an educational tool in universities.We also plan on developing it further , for now this is only a prototype, its full potential is yet to come. For more information please check the presentation and the demonstration video, also don't forget to look at the github repo.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon
"Dreamixer is a Stable Diffusion based AI tool to generate comic strips from text. Dreamixer aims to democratize the comic strip creation process so everyone with an idea and aim to express it using comic strips is not blocked by his lack of graphics and designing skills. If you can express your idea as a comic strip script giving scene setting and dialogue, Dreamixer will do the rest. It will generate the comic strip with given scene setting and characters in a consistent style. It was also append the dialogues spoken by characters as a text bubble. Later on, we plan to give ability to our users to edit specific portions of the comic strip using in-painting and other advance Stable Diffusion features.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon
"Visual storytelling is one of the many ways educators use to assist in the child's growth. However, often times educators will have to improvise when trying to find relevant material (movies or story books) that can help in guiding the child in a specific situation with the child's needs and accessibility accommodations. For example, a child with physical differences can be facing a situation from a different child and an educator is keen on addressing the situation. Therefore, developing a solution that can create custom images for storytelling based on the unique characteristics of the child can be very empowering to the educational system.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon

"Pictures generated by the Stable Diffusion are used for mental health therapeutic purposes. There are two main services, the free in-app plan and the premium chromotherapy in the metaverse. First of all, the main goal of the application is to be able to ask the users about their current mood and the reasons behind it to generate an image based on the theories of mental health and chroma therapy to improve overall mental health. The application first starts by asking about the overall mood of the user: Great, Good, Okay, Bad, Awful . Based on these questions the model generates an image that is soothing to the mood and improves the mood of the user throughout the day. Then, the metaverse is used to provide immersive chromotherapy in the metaverse for all. It consists of the panorama version or full-screen version of the picture being trained and generated using Stable Diffusion. Then, throughout the chromotherapy, we could let use relaxation-stimulating colors to provide immersive therapeutic experiences, whether it is the VR feature on ma mobile phone, the VR feature from a VR headset, the AR feature from an Apple device, and more that are compatible with Spatial XR.",https://lablab.ai/event/stable-diffusion-hackathon

"Messenger apps like Discord & Slack have ""channels"" where multiple parties can send hundreds of texts daily.

The summary is split into parts, and each part has a timestamp/link to its original messages. Users can call Tal;dera to extract message history and generate summaries (tl;dr's) of previous message chunks, given parameters such as number of messages, start time/date, output format, and chunk sizes. Summaries are given in an organized, embedded format, and are linked to where the conversations took place in the chats. Even though this was a challenging project for us, we were happy with what we were able to get done, and believe that this project has potential for B2B SaaS applications to team managers, employees, and chat service providers.

It is pre-trained on a subset of of the LAION-5B dataset and the model can be run at home on a consumer grade graphics card so everyone can create stunning art within seconds.,https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion
"Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are a type of image generation technique that work by iteratively ""de-noising"" data in a latent representation space, and then decoding the representation into a full image. This is in contrast to other popular image synthesis methods such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the auto-regressive technique used by DALL-E. The Stable Diffusion model is created by a collaboration between engineers and researchers from CompVis, Stability AI, and LAION and released under a Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license, wich means that it can be used for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The release of this file is the culmination of many hours of collective effort to compress the visual information of humanity into a few gigabytes. Furthermore, the model also supports image-to-image style transfer, as well as upscaling and generating an images from a simple sketch. Included is also an AI-based Safty Classifier, which understands concepts and other factors in generations to remove outputs that may not be desired by the model user.",https://lablab.ai/tech/stable-diffusion

"During the hackathon, we fine-tuned GPT-3 and built a self-analysis tool that helps one objectively assess their problem and develop new ideas for solving it. It can be used by people who can't access mental health care because of high prices and stigma. It is based on CBT and should be highly effective in the following cases: 1. A person has a problem and doesn't know how to solve it. For example, ""I can't keep up with deadlines,"" or ""My parents are overprotective."" 2. A person can't make a decision. ""Should I move?"", ""Should I accept an offer from a new company?"" etc. 3. A person can't sort out their thoughts. ""I can't understand why I'm so uncomfortable being a dad,"" ""Why have I become so irritable?"" etc. 4. A person wants to improve their relationship. ""I'm so jealous,"" ""We fight all the time,"" ""I'm not happy with my wife. I cheated, and I feel guilty"". In therapy, people who are objective about their situation and able to set specific goals tend to achieve better results. This tool does exactly that. A typical session consists of three parts: 1. Analysis. This part includes questions that make the person analyze various aspects of the situation and draw an objective picture. The essence of this part is the transition from an emotional to a rational perception of reality. 2. Empathy. It consists of a comprehensive generalizing statement aimed at supporting the client emotionally. 3. Decision. It consists of questions that allow the person to analyze the availability of resources and ways to solve the problem. Questions force the person to move from emotions to concrete steps toward the goal.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"Our idea for a Shopify Print on Demand app that uses DALL-E inpainting would be to create an app that allows users to add custom images to their products. The app would use DALL-E to personalize the images based on a description provided by the user. For example, a user might want to add a picture of their grandparent’s dog to a t-shirt. They could then add props like a “Santa hat” to the dog, and DALL-E would generate the image and add it to the t-shirt or any other POD product. This would allow users to easily customize their products with unique images without needing any design skills. Another use case for this could be using the DALL-E outpainting tool, where a user might upload a picture of their own dog and ask the app to put it in a certain environment, i.e. “space”. The app would significantly reduce the turnover time and processes of personalized POD (currently 1-3 days) and design costs (currently $1-$5/design). We would charge merchants just $1 for each actual purchase on their store that was made via PrintAi. Overall, the app would make it easy for personalized POD merchants to allow their customers to add custom, high-quality images to their products, making their online stores more unique and appealing to customers.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"Try it out: https://customer-support-gpt.vercel.app/ Founders and customer support representatives often get an influx of repetitive emails that could be easily automated using GPT-3. The challenge is that GPT-3 knowledge is general and doesn't have company-specific information. Enter Customer Support GPT, it uses the company's internal knowledge such as frequently asked questions, articles, etc. to give company-specific answers. If it doesn't know the answer, it'll flag to be answered by a human. How it works: To get company-specific responses, Customer Support GPT does the following: Parse and create an index of company data. When an incoming customer support query is presented, the index is searched for the most relevant result(s). If none are present, flag it to a human reviewer. This result(s) are passed into GPT-3 along with the incoming query, to return a personalized, relevant response. Future work is to integrate with Zendesk, Crisp, and other providers to pre-generate answers and use in real life.

Lastly, we used Vercel to host the front end and Heroku to host the backend.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon
"This is a small web service project that allows you to upload a mp3 audio or provide a youtube link - the source audio then gets transcribed and summarized by openAi models. The project was realized as part of OpenAI Whisper, GPT3, Codex & DALL-E 2 Hackathon together with colonelWalterKurtz and PioSikorski. The app was realized using python 3.10 with libraries such as Flask, openai, moviepy and pytube. The audio transcript is fed into the GPT-3 model in several pieces to ensure that it does not shorten and erase too much information. The prototype allows to convert short videos efficiently however it takes significantly more time to process longer audio files due to slow working of the requests to each model. The project provides a proof of concept that could potentailly be useful to many people who often do not wish to spend much time listening to audio files such as podcasts and if improved could allow to deliver such service online.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"By offering a user-friendly and adaptable framework for website building, this project leverages text-DaVinci-003 and Whisper to create websites for people. This may be especially useful for individuals and small businesses that lack the technical skills or resources to create their own websites from scratch. To use the platform, a user would likely interact with their keyboards or whisper through a natural language interface. The user would provide information about their websites, such as the type of content they want to include and the design elements they prefer, and our application would use this information to generate a website based on pre-designed templates and customizations.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

"Alternative name (BitVote.net) full concept here: http://bitvote.net/?page_id=41 Relevant description / summary Alternative name (BitVote.net) entire concept here: http://bitvote.net/?page_id=41 Relevant description/summary textCollab is likely going to be stage 1 to 3 from the whole BitVote idea above. BitVote will start to operate at the discussion and proposal creation level. Off-setting the discussion to more internet platforms (such as Reddit, in the future). As step one in the process, textCollab/BitVote users may pick up a popular question or issue in their respective community. In the next step, the users start proposals sessions on this platform to address the question or any of the available questions. Anyone can start a question or issue on BitVote, similar to sites like Quora. If the case matches the keywords or content of another already in the system, the user is encouraged to review the previous one. He can still go ahead and create a similar proposal or text document, but the algorithm will still group it thematically based on content and keywords. As soon as that is done, anyone that is registered with the system can see new issues by region, type, language, or other keywords. A brand new issue or question will still need to have proposals in it. One can start writing a proposal for the question at hand. One of the essential central features of BitVote, is the editor, and this will be the textCollab project. As the user is writing the algorithm is dynamically scanning the content. Searching through any sources (Wikipedia, internet archives, academic journals, meta-searches in search engines), and presenting the results as a part of the screen (for computers as devices; a secondary tab with notices for mobile devices). One additional source will be the textCollab database, scanning for similarities between the current and previous proposals already in the system. From the thematic content analysis, the user can see relevant papers and sources that can quickly inform him to improve his proposal or use them as sources. Suppose the proposal is very high in similarity with another. In that case, the user will be prompted to join in support of that proposal unless there are any additions or sub-versions to that proposal. The aim is to reduce the total amount of proposals and foster synthesis. Thus, creating more complete proposals from many authors in the system. This stage can take weeks, depending on the configuration of the person who is running this proposal instance has chosen. Furthermore, there may be competing proposal chains in the system with different configurations. If both are set to public view, both can benefit from existing content and work in the textCollab archive. On the other hand, there are cases where a BitVote process will be started by a corporate entity or organization where only select groups of people will have electronic access keys to see the full content (or any configuration of the above). In the case of competing proposals, one may arrive at a solution using different time periods, different groups of people and different implementer(s) or auditor(s) of the voted solution. The content ranking should be done continuously but iterate until after the Proposal period. The rank value of every proposal (or synthesis of proposals, for that matter, for larger groups) is based on some of the following: Support by primary academic sources. (Max 0.5) Support by other literature. (Max 0.2) Education or specialization of the author (thematic match). (Max 0.1) Thematic match to the question addressed. (Max 0.1) User ranking and ratings. (Max 0.1) Potentially other factors. The voting stage is generally a simpler process but depending on the whole session or BitVote process configuration one can configure a vote with different rules appropriate for the occasion. And what should happen if a satisfactory result is not reached? Return to Proposal session for a set amount of time to foster more formal discussion, or re-iterate the Vote session until there is a clear result. Assuming there is a clear winner, this part of the process is done, now depending on the BitVote process configuration there can be a vote for who will be the implementer or a public competition for potential implementers to compete. The next stage can be assigned to an auditing authority that will assess and report back in the system how the implementation of the proposal went. All this stays in archival to be used continuously in the system and also for historical record. If a great proposal and implementation is reached that will be featured and highlighted to see what has been learned, but the same really for a failed proposal or implementation. We need such methods to be able to cope with the amount of information we will have to deal with in a large scale application of meritocratic democracy today – that means very big populations and thus countless submissions of proposals to dig through. That would be impossible without a smart collaboration design. The intent is to let the best ideas come forth, be expressed and compete. Choose democratically from those, and then implement and assess.",https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-gpt3-codex-dalle2-hackathon

Jason Calacanis is considered by many as one of the greatest startup investors of our time and predicts that the laid off tech workers will be the biggest winners for 2023.,https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"As Silicon Valley continues to right size across the biggest tech companies and the trend is expected to move across the globe, there is a major opportunity for those who are left without a job.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"According to Calacanis, these laid-off tech workers have the potential to become extremely successful if they band together in groups of two, three, or four and start their own companies. This is because, as Calacanis notes, these individuals possess the key skills necessary to build and run successful startups, including development, product management, and other important technical capabilities.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Calacanis argues that these laid-off tech workers can make ""incredible lemonade from these lemons"" by taking control of their own destinies and starting their own companies. In fact, he believes that the startup space will be dominated by these laid-off tech workers who choose to start their own businesses and that they will be the truly big winners in the coming year.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023

"One key piece of advice that Calacanis offers is for these laid-off tech workers to start their companies with two or three friends. As he notes, this is because startups with multiple founders tend to get funded faster than those with only one. Additionally, having a team of developers and other talented individuals will be essential for success in the startup world.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Overall, Calacanis's prediction is a stark reminder that even the most difficult of circumstances can be turned into opportunities, and those who are willing to take a chance and create something new can truly succeed. For laid-off tech workers in 2023, it is a chance to ""take control of the destiny"" and to create something that they can truly be proud of.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Based on the boom of performance in AI technology of the last 24 months, generative AI will be the winning technology of 2023 and therefore the startups created by laid-off tech workers should focus on it, as it is one of the most promising and rapidly growing areas in technology today. Generative AI refers to systems that can generate new and unique outputs, such as natural language, images, and music, based on a set of inputs and algorithms.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Calacanis believes that the demand for Generative AI-powered products and services will only continue to increase in the coming years and that startups in this field will have a significant advantage. With the trend of automation and the increasing adoption of AI in various industry verticals, businesses are looking for more advanced AI solutions.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Startups that are focused on Generative AI can leverage their technical skills to develop cutting-edge products and services that can help to drive innovation and growth in a wide range of industries. From healthcare, and finance to retail and beyond, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"Furthermore, Generative AI startups also have the potential to attract large amounts of funding from venture capitalists and other investors, as this is an area of high interest for them.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023
"In conclusion, Calacanis's prediction of laid-off tech workers becoming truly big winners in 2023 by starting their own companies, especially if they focus on Generative AI is an exciting prospect. It presents an opportunity for them to not just overcome the setback of losing their jobs but also capitalize on the future of technology and leverage it to create something that can change the world.",https://lablab.ai/blog/state-of-the-art-ai-jason-calacanis-the-greatest-startup-investor-of-all-time-number-one-prediction-for-2023

"AI21 Studio is a text-to-text generative AI, that offers its users the ability to generate text completions for a given prompt using Jurassic-1 Language models. https://docs.ai21.com/docs/complete-api Text completion is the most frequently used method, because we can adjust it to our needs by giving examples. Let's say you want to create an application that suggests ideas for engaging tweets to promote a brand of a product. We would use Completion as well. We can find an example setup on AI 21 playground https://studio.ai21.com/playground/complete.",https://lablab.ai/t/ai21-labs-tutorial-how-to-adopt-ai21-to-your-ai-project
"The ideal technique to make an application function in the real world should be considered when you have a concept for it. Creating API calls with a program like Postman or using the playground both make it simple to test out new services. Making API requests client-side, directly from the application, is typically the quickest approach to construct a prototype.",https://lablab.ai/t/ai21-labs-tutorial-how-to-adopt-ai21-to-your-ai-project
"Excellent choices for this are Replit and Streamlit. However, because you will have to reveal your API key, which you should never share, this is not a secure technique for a web application.",https://lablab.ai/t/ai21-labs-tutorial-how-to-adopt-ai21-to-your-ai-project
"You must develop a back-end service if you want to make sure that your application is secure and scalable. If scalability is important, this is an excellent method to stand out in hackathons. Back-end frameworks include Node.js, Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails, among others. These frameworks enable you to simply construct a safe and scalable application since they offer a number of capabilities and are often well-documented.",https://lablab.ai/t/ai21-labs-tutorial-how-to-adopt-ai21-to-your-ai-project
